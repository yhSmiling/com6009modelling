function [agt]=migrate(agt,cn)

%migration functions for class HERRING
%agt=herring object
%cn - current agent number

%SUMMARY OF HERRING MIGRATE RULE
%If a herring has not eaten, it will pick a random migration direction
%If it will leave the edge of the model, the direction is incremented by 45
%degrees at it will try again (up to 8 times)
